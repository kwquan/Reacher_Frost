# Reacher_Frost
This repo contains the code used to solve Reacher Frost, which is a cross-over of OpenAI's Reacher & Frozen Lake environments, using Dynamic Programming

Similar to Frozen Lake, the goal of the agent is to find the optimal path from Start to Goal while avoiding the Holes.
Instead of a penguin, we have a robotic arm with an end-effector plotting out the optimal path.
